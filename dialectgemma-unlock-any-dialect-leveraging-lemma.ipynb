This pipeline leverages techniques such as lemmatization and contextual similarity analysis to preprocess dialect datasets, thereby enhancing the translation accuracy of language models.\n\n### Methodology\n1. **Input Transformation**:\n   - Dialectal input text, which traditional language models may struggle to interpret, is first processed through a lemmatization step. This simplifies the text by reducing words to their base or canonical forms.\n   \n2. **Translation via Language Model**:\n   - The preprocessed text is then passed through a large language model (LLM). The LLM is tasked with translating the simplified text into the target base language, ensuring both syntactic and semantic accuracy.\n\n### Key Advantages\n- **Improved Comprehensibility**: By transforming dialectal input into a more standardized form, the system significantly enhances the LLM's ability to perform accurate translations.\n- **Efficiency**: The use of lemmatization and contextual similarity minimizes the complexity of the input, reducing the computational load on the LLM.\n\nThis approach demonstrates a scalable and effective method for translating dialects, making the resulting system both practical and robust for real-world applications.\n\n\n| Criteria | Compliant |\n|---|---|\n| **Compliant:** The submission was consistent with the guidelines and instructions. | [**yes**] |\n| **Topical:** The submission was relevant to the prize categories. | [**yes**] |\n| **Open:** The notebook and all of the underlying data sources were made public.

This setup provides high-quality translations at scale.\n- **Alternative Method**: To enable end-users to perform translations, a fallback implementation was developed.

They act as a base for customization rather than a rigid pipeline.\n* **Leveraging Existing Translations:** The project already possesses datasets translated into Italian and English for various dialects. The code prioritizes utilizing these existing translations to minimize redundancy.\n* **Local Development Focus:** This step is intended for local development and experimentation. The translated datasets are already available publicly, eliminating the need to rerun this phase unless specific customizations are necessary.\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n1. **Avoiding Redundant Translation (Conditional Loading):**\n\nThe provided code snippet showcases a technique to prevent unnecessary translation of data that has already been processed. It checks for a global variable `ds_overlap_translated` which is assumed to be a dictionary storing previously translated data. If the variable doesn't exist, the code initializes it and attempts to load the latest saved version of the translated data from disk (using `glob` and `json.load`). This way, the script avoids re-translating data that has already been handled.\n\n2. **Iterating Through Overlap Data (Translation Loop):**\n\nAssuming there's no pre-existing translated data, or if new data needs processing, the code iterates through a dataset (`ds_overlap`) containing the dialectal text. It uses `tqdm` to display progress bars for both the overall loop and individual topics within the dataset.\n\n* **Skipping Translated Topics:**\n\nFor each topic (key) in the dataset, the code first checks if it exists in the `ds_overlap_translated` dictionary. If it does, and the number of entries in both datasets is equal, it signifies that all entries for this topic have already been translated. In such cases, the script skips processing this topic entirely to avoid redundant translations.\n\n* **Translating Individual Entries:**\n\nIf a topic requires translation, the code iterates through each entry (value) within that topic. It performs the following steps:\n\n1. **Lemmatization (Optional):**  A function called `lemmatize_data` is used to potentially lemmatize the dialectal text (convert words to their base form). This step may be necessary depending on the chosen translation model and desired outcome.\n2. **Translation:** A function called `translate` is used to translate the (optionally) lemmatized text. The specific implementation of this function depends on how the translation model is integrated and accessed.\n3. **Extracting Translated Text and Cleaning:**\n\n    * The translation response is assumed to be in JSON format. The script extracts the actual translated text from the response and removes any unnecessary prefix or extra whitespace related to the specific model used (e.g., \"assistant\" prefix added by the LLAMA model).\n4. **Storing Translated Text:** The cleaned, translated text is appended to the corresponding topic list within the `ds_overlap_translated` dictionary.\n\n* **Error Handling:**\n\nThe code includes basic error handling using a `try-except` block. If an exception occurs during translation for a specific entry (index), it logs the error message and the problematic index within the topic. However, it also deletes the entire topic from the `ds_overlap_translated` dictionary to prevent issues with potentially corrupted data for that topic.\n\n* **Periodic Saving:**\n\nEvery five iterations (corresponding to translating five entries), the script saves the current state of the `ds_overlap_translated` dictionary to a gzipped JSON file on disk. This allows for resuming the translation process from the latest checkpoint in case of interruptions or errors.\n\n* **Final Saving:**\n\nFinally, after processing all topics and entries, the script saves the final version of the `ds_overlap_translated` dictionary containing all translated text to a separate JSON file.\n\nIn summary, this code provides a flexible framework for translating dialectal text using a pre-trained model. It prioritizes utilizing existing translations, avoids redundancy, and allows for easy customization and error handling.  \n**_However, it's important to note that this code is intended for local development and experimentation. The translated datasets are already available publicly, so this script might not be necessary for production use._**","metadata":{}},{"id":"7624896160cad0f6","cell_type":"code","source":"# # Dirty hack to avoid losing the already translated dataset.\n# if \"ds_overlap_translated\" not in globals():\n#     ds_overlap_translated = defaultdict(list)\n#     # Load the latest file saved, instead of restart from 0\n#     files = glob(f\"{dialect_to_ita_eng_path}/ds_overlap_translated_ia_lemma_it*\")\n#     if len(files) > 0:\n#         files.sort(key=lambda x: os.path.getmtime(x))\n#         ds_overlap_translated = defaultdict(list, json.load(gzip.open(files[-1])))","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-14T23:43:04.558728Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-14T23:43:04.558942Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-14T23:43:04.562445Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-14T23:43:04.558925Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-14T23:43:04.561520Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":8},{"id":"6fe7831849949d82","cell_type":"code","source":"# print(f\"Len of already translated data: {len(ds_overlap_translated)}\")\n# n = 0\n# for k, vs in tqdm(ds_overlap.items(), total=len(ds_overlap), position=0):\n#     # Avoid translating the already managed topics\n#     if k in ds_overlap_translated and len(vs) == len(ds_overlap_translated[k]):\n#         continue\n#     for idx, v in enumerate(tqdm(vs, leave=False, position=1, desc=k)):\n#         if (idx + 1) <= len(ds_overlap_translated[k]):\n#             continue\n#         try:\n#             lemmatized_v = lemmatize_data(v)\n#             res = translate(lemmatized_v)\n#             response = (\n#                 res.json()[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n#                 # This cleaning is related to the LLAMA model used.\n#                 .removeprefix(\"<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\").strip()\n#             )\n#             ds_overlap_translated[k].append(response)\n#         except Exception as e:\n#             print(f\"Missing idx: {idx} of {k} | Error: {e}\")\n#             del ds_overlap_translated[k]\n#             break\n#     n += 1\n#     if n % 5 == 0:\n#         # Save the dataset every 5 wikipedia webpages translated\n#         fname = f\"data/ds_overlap_translated_ia_lemma_it_{n}_{len(ds_overlap_translated)}.json\"\n#         with gzip.open(fname, \"wt\") as zipfile:\n#             json.dump(ds_overlap_translated, zipfile)\n# # Save the last version of the dataset\n# json.dump(ds_overlap_translated, open(\"ds_overlap_translated_ia_lemma_it.json\", \"wt\"))","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-14T23:43:04.565250Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-14T23:43:04.565476Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-14T23:43:04.575955Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-14T23:43:04.565456Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-14T23:43:04.575145Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":9},{"id":"cbf5f6a4-5a7a-4381-ba75-5908ea0b3a98","cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Chapter 4: Dataset Aggregation and Cleaning\n\nThis chapter focuses on the code responsible for preparing the raw and translated datasets into a format suitable for training a fine-tuned language model. \n\n### Objective\n\nThe primary objective of this code is to combine raw dialectal text with its corresponding translated text (e.g., Italian or English) into a structured format. This structured format ensures consistency and compatibility with the chosen language model.\n\n### Key Features\n\nThe code incorporates several key functionalities to clean and prepare the dataset:\n\n* **Aggregation:** It matches the original dialectal entries with their translated counterparts, ensuring that each data point has both the source and target language text associated with it.\n* **Outlier Detection and Removal:**  The script identifies entries with unusual patterns in terms of:\n    * Token length (number of words/sub-words after tokenization)\n    * Punctuation ratio (percentage of punctuation characters)\n    * Word count (number of words)\n* **TF-IDF Similarity Check:**  This step aims to identify and remove duplicate or overly similar entries within the dataset. This helps to improve the model's training diversity by reducing redundancy.\n* **Statistics and Visualization (Optional):**  The code might include functionalities to analyze various statistics of the dataset, such as token length distribution and word-to-token ratios. These statistics can be helpful for understanding the dataset characteristics and identifying potential issues.\n\n\n### Code Breakdown\n\n1. **Dataset Configuration (Commented Out):**\n\nThe code snippet starts with commented-out sections that showcase a template configuration (`dataset_config`). This allows for easy switching between different languages by specifying:\n\n* `starting_language`: The source dialectal language (e.g., Sicilian, Neapolitan).\n* `wikilanguage`: The corresponding Wikipedia language code (used for potential filtering).\n* Paths to the translated datasets in Italian (`italian`) and English (`english`).\n\n2. **Loading Translated Data:**\n\nThe code loads the translated datasets for both Italian (`ds_overlap_it`) and English (`ds_overlap_en`) from their respective JSON files using the `json.load` function.\n\n3. **`aggregate_dataset` Function:**\n\nThis function takes two dictionaries as input:\n\n* `raw_base`: Dictionary containing the raw dialectal text (topics as keys, lists of strings as values).\n* `raw_translated`: Dictionary containing the translated text (topics as keys, lists of strings as values).\n\nThe function iterates through each topic in the translated dataset (`raw_translated`). For each topic, it retrieves the corresponding list of raw dialectal text (`base_data`) and the translated sentences (`translated_data`). Then, it creates a list of inner dictionaries, where each inner dictionary contains a key-value pair:\n\n* `original`: The raw dialectal sentence for this data point.\n* `translated`: The corresponding translated sentence (Italian or English).\n\nFinally, the function adds this list of inner dictionaries (representing the data points for a specific topic) to the main dictionary (`ds`) with the topic name as the key. This results in a structured dictionary where each key is a topic and the corresponding value is a list of dictionaries containing both the original and translated text for each data point within that topic.\n\n4. **`filter_dataset` Function:**\n\nThis function performs cleaning and filtering on a translated dataset:\n\n* `language`: The dialect language of the dataset (e.g., Sicilian).\n* `ds_translated`: The translated dataset dictionary.\n* `n` (optional): A threshold for outlier removal (data points with extreme token length, punctuation ratio, or word count).\n* `ds_base` (optional): The raw dialectal text dataset (used for consistency checks).\n\n* **Handling Missing Raw Data:**\n\n   - If the `ds_base` parameter is not provided, the function calls the  `load_raw_data` function to retrieve the raw dialectal text for the specified topics.\n\n* **Matching Topics:**\n\n   - The function identifies common topics that exist in both the translated and raw datasets. This ensures that data points with translations are matched with their corresponding raw counterparts.\n\n* **Filtering Based on Content:**\n\n   - The code (commented out) suggests removing entries containing specific patterns like `{|`, `|}`, suggesting potential Wikipedia-related content that might be noisy for the training data.\n\n* **Outlier Removal Based on Punctuation and Word Count:**\n\n   - The `clean_dataset` function is used to remove entries with high numbers of punctuation characters or unusual word counts. This helps to improve data quality and prevent the model from learning from potentially noisy examples.\n\n* **Final Cleaning and Assertions:**\n\n   - The function performs final cleaning on both the raw and translated datasets using the `","metadata":{}},{"id":"c727f0c7-462a-449a-8bf6-f4e931ceb2dd","cell_type":"code","source":"# Load the dataset\n# Here we have the template configuration in order to play with different (already managed languages)\n\n# dataset_config = {\n#     \"starting_language\": \"sicilian\",\n#     \"wikilanguage\": 'scn',\n\n#     \"italian\": f\"{dialect_to_ita_eng_path}/ds_overlap_translated_scn_lemma_it.json\",\n#     \"english\": f\"{dialect_to_ita_eng_path}/ds_overlap_translated_scn_lemma_en.json\"\n# }\n\n# dataset_config = {\n#     \"starting_language\": \"napolitan\",\n#     \"wikilanguage\": 'nap',\n\n#     \"italian\": f\"{dialect_to_ita_eng_path}/ds_overlap_translated_nap_lemma_it.json\",\n#     \"english\": f\"{dialect_to_ita_eng_path}/ds_overlap_translated_nap_lemma_en.json\"\n# }\n\n\n# dataset_config = {\n#     \"starting_language\": \"venetian\",\n#     \"wikilanguage\": 'vec',\n\n#     \"italian\": f\"{dialect_to_ita_eng_path}/ds_overlap_translated_vec_lemma_it.json\",\n#     \"english\": f\"{dialect_to_ita_eng_path}/ds_overlap_translated_vec_lemma_en.json\"\n# }\n\ndataset_config = {\n    \"starting_language\": \"interlingua\",\n    \"wikilanguage\": 'ia',\n\n    \"italian\": f\"{dialect_to_ita_eng_path}/ds_overlap_translated_ia_lemma_it.json\",\n    \"english\": f\"{dialect_to_ita_eng_path}/ds_overlap_translated_ia_lemma_en.json\"\n}\n\n\nit_fname = dataset_config[\"italian\"]\nen_fname = dataset_config[\"english\"]\nstarting_language = dataset_config[\"starting_language\"]\nwikilanguage = dataset_config[\"wikilanguage\"]\n# NOTE: On your local env, the dataset will be gzipped (remember to change from plain `open` to `gzip.open`)\nds_overlap_it: Dict[str, List[str]] = json.load(open(it_fname))\nds_overlap_en: Dict[str, List[str]] = json.load(open(en_fname))","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-14T23:43:04.577141Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-14T23:43:04.577375Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-14T23:43:04.629679Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-14T23:43:04.577357Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-14T23:43:04.628528Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":10},{"id":"5173c46acbdb8fe7","cell_type":"code","source":"def aggregate_dataset(\n    raw_base: Dict[str, List[str]], raw_translated: Dict[str, List[str]]\n) -> Dict[str, List[Dict[str, List[str]]]]:\n    \"\"\"Aggregates two raw datasets (base and translated) into a single structured dataset.\n\n    Args:\n        :param: raw_base: A dictionary where keys are topics and values are lists of strings (base data).\n        :param: raw_translated: A dictionary where keys are topics and values are lists of strings (translated data).\n\n    Returns:\n        :return: A dictionary where keys are topics and values are lists of dictionaries.\n            Each inner dictionary contains the \"original\" and \"translated\" strings for a given data point.\n    \"\"\"\n    ds = {}\n    for topic in raw_translated:\n        base_data = raw_base[topic]\n        translated_data = raw_translated[topic]\n        d = []\n        for v1, v2 in zip(base_data, translated_data):\n            d.append({\"original\": v1, \"translated\": v2})\n        ds[topic] = d\n    return ds\n\n\ndef filter_dataset(language, ds_translated, n=2, ds_base=None):\n    \"\"\"Filters and cleans a translated dataset based on a base dataset.\n\n    Args:\n        :param: language: The language of the dataset.\n        :param: ds_translate: A dictionary representing the translated dataset (topic -> list of strings).\n        :param: n: A threshold for outlier removal.\n        :param: ds_base: An optional dictionary representing the base dataset (topic -> list of strings).

Chapter 6.1: Creating the final dataest (train + test)\nThe test set is retrieved using the cosine similarity betwen the between TF-IDF vectors of the documents.\nThis is because I want to cover as many topics as possible, to let the network have the chance to generalize better.\n\n## Document Similarity Filtering\n\nThis code snippet filters a Pandas DataFrame (`df`) to remove similar documents based on their content, while grouping by starting language, translated language, and task type. It uses a similarity threshold to identify and remove near-duplicate entries.\n\n### Functionality\n\n1. **Grouping:** The DataFrame is grouped by `starting_language`, `translated_language`, and `task_type`. This ensures that similarity checks are performed only within documents that share these attributes.\n\n2. **Similarity Removal:** For each group, the `remove_similar_documents` function is called. This function takes the group's DataFrame and the column containing the document content (`original_content`) as input. It uses a `similarity_threshold` of 0.2 to determine which documents are considered similar. The function returns two DataFrames:\n    - `new_df`: Contains the documents that are *not* considered similar.\n    - `dups`: Contains the documents that *are* considered similar (duplicates).\n\n3. **Concatenation and Logging:** The code then concatenates the `new_df` and `dups` DataFrames from each group into `filtered_df` and `duplicated_df`, respectively. It also prints a message indicating the number of entries removed for each group.\n\n4. **Memory Management:** After processing all groups, the original `df` is deleted, and `filtered_df` is assigned to `df`. This is followed by deleting `filtered_df` and calling `gc.collect()` to free up memory. The DataFrame is also reset to avoid potential issues with the index.\n\n5. **Duplicate Ratio Calculation:** The code calculates the percentage of removed documents (duplicates) relative to the final filtered DataFrame.","metadata":{}},{"id":"f476fffd4c2c09ce","cell_type":"code","source":"# Finding similar documents that share the same languages and task_type (translate, describe)\nfiltered_df =

snippet creates training and testing datasets from the filtered DataFrame (`df`) and the duplicated DataFrame (`duplicated_df`), respectively. It then saves these datasets to disk in Hugging Face format.\n\n### Functionality\n\n1. **Grouped Prompt Display:** The code first iterates through the DataFrame `df`, grouped by `starting_language`, `translated_language`, and `task_type`. For each group, it prints the group's identifier and a sample prompt from that group. This provides a quick overview of the data within each group.\n\n2. **Dataset Splitting:** The filtered DataFrame (`df`) is used to create the training dataset (`ds_train`), and the duplicated DataFrame (`duplicated_df`) is used to create the testing dataset (`ds_test`). Both datasets are shuffled using `sample(frac=1, random_state=seed)` to ensure randomness and reproducibility (using a predefined `seed` variable).\n\n3. **Topic Analysis:** The code then analyzes the distribution of topics in the training and testing datasets. It calculates:\n    - The number of examples in each dataset.\n    - The number of common topics between the two datasets.\n    - The number of topics present only in the training dataset.\n    - The number of topics present only in the testing dataset.\n    This analysis helps understand the overlap and differences between the training and testing sets in terms of topic coverage.\n\n4. **Dataset Conversion and Saving:** The Pandas DataFrames (`ds_train` and `ds_test`) are converted to Hugging Face `Dataset` objects using `Dataset.from_pandas()`. The `convert_dtypes()` method is used to ensure proper data type handling. The datasets are then saved to disk in Hugging Face format using `save_to_disk()`. The filenames include the `starting_language` and the `DATASET_TYPES` (assumed to be a list of strings defining the dataset type).\n\n5. **Example Display:** Finally, the code retrieves and displays the first example from the training dataset using a loop and `break`. This allows for a quick inspection of the dataset's structure.","metadata":{}},{"id":"4b346fb1573af91c","cell_type":"code","source":"for group, tdf in df.groupby([\"starting_language\", \"translated_language\", \"task_type\"]):\n    print(\"=\" * 30, group, \"=\" * 30)\n    print(tdf[\"prompt\"].sample(1).item())\n\nds_train = df.sample(frac=1, random_state=seed)\nds_test = duplicated_df.sample(frac=1, random_state=seed)\ntrain_topics = set(ds_train[\"topic\"].unique())\ntest_topics = set(ds_test[\"topic\"].unique())\nprint(\n    f\"Train examples: {len(ds_train)} | Test Examples: {len(ds_test)} | Common topics: {len(train_topics.intersection(test_topics))} | Only train topics: {len(train_topics - test_topics)} | Only test topics: {len(test_topics - train_topics)}\"\n)\ndataset_train = Dataset.from_pandas(ds_train.convert_dtypes())\n\n# NOTE:\n# The `describe` dataset will not be used during evaluation.\n# However, we save for reference if we want to evaluate how the network is able to generate dialogues in the dialect language.\ndataset_test = Dataset.from_pandas(ds_test.convert_dtypes())\ndataset_train.save_to_disk(\n    f\"datasets/{starting_language}_{'_'.join(DATASET_TYPES)}_train.hf\"\n)\ndataset_test.save_to_disk(\n    f\"datasets/{starting_language}_{'_'.join(DATASET_TYPES)}_test.hf\"\n)\nfor x in dataset_train:\n    break\nx","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-14T23:43:59.647409Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-14T23:43:59.647709Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-14T23:44:00.485269Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-14T23:43:59.647683Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-14T23:44:00.484605Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"============================== ('english', 'interlingua', 'describe') ==============================\n<start_of_turn>user\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

He was born of an unmarried mother and unknown father. Before contributing to the creation of Ido, he had been a fervent Esperantist and had helped spread the international language at the beginning of the 20th century. He served as an intermediary between Zamenhof and the French publishing house Hachette, which then began publishing an important series of works in Esperanto, which significantly boosted the movement at that time. Zamenhof, the father of Esperanto, wanted to give an ideological basis to his international language and for this purpose intended to create a spiritual movement called homaranismo, in other words a neutral and common spirituality (as the international language was complicit with it) to create meeting places where people from all cultures and religions could have a common cult without having to renounce their own traditional religion and could become mutually friendly. That era (around 1905) was very unfavorable to religion and spirituality (it was the time of the most violent confrontations between Laity and Churches in France). Homaranismo could not be born. Louis de Beaufront was a Catholic with very conservative opinions. He proposed to Zamenhof to push Esperanto in the neutral environment of tourism. The author of Esperanto refused, claiming that he did not want Esperanto to become a commercial affair but had to remain purely idealistic. At that time a schism became inevitable and de Beaufront began his association with Louis Couturat.\n\n<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n### Response:\nLouis de Beaufront (1855 usque 1935), cuje ver nomine esseva Louis Chevreux ma cuje biographia non es toto ben cognoscite, esseva un del autores e pioneros de ido.

Unfortunately, due to hardware limitations, hyperparameter optimization using Optuna wasn't feasible so I had to manually iterate over the parameters.\n\nThe provided code snippet showcases how to load the configuration from a JSON file (commented out) or directly define it as a Python dictionary (`model_config`). This dictionary specifies various crucial aspects of the fine-tuning process, including:\n\n* `dataset_name`: The name of the dataset used for fine-tuning. This dataset should be formatted for the specific task you want the model to excel at. The example uses a dataset named after the starting language and the target task (e.g., \"{starting_language}_translate_describe\").\n* `model_id`: The identifier for the pre-trained Gemma-2 model being used. In this case, \"google/gemma-2-2b-it\" refers to the 2 billion parameter version of Gemma-2.\n* `modules_to_save`: A list of specific modules within the model that will be fine-tuned. Here, only the \"lm_head\" (language model head) is being updated.\n* `r`, `lora_alpha`, `epochs`, `dropout`, `learning_rate`, `lr_scheduler_type`: These hyperparameters control various aspects of the fine-tuning process, such as the rank for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), learning rate decay schedule, and number of training epochs.\n\nFollowing the configuration definition, the code extracts specific values from the dictionary for clarity and readability. \n\nNext, the code utilizes the `FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained` function from the  Transformers library to load the pre-trained Gemma-2 model and its corresponding tokenizer. The `max_seq_length` parameter defines the maximum sequence length the model can handle.\n\nFinally, the script loads the training and testing datasets using the `Dataset.load_from_disk` function. It's important to note that the testing dataset is modified to remove entries belonging to the \"describe\" task, ensuring the model is only evaluated on translation tasks during the fine-tuning process.","metadata":{}},{"id":"5284762f885f2f89","cell_type":"code","source":"def load_base_model(model_id, max_seq_length, device=\"sequential\"):\n    model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(\n        model_name=model_id,\n        max_seq_length=max_seq_length,\n        dtype=None,\n        load_in_4bit=True,\n        device_map=device,\n    )\n    return model, tokenizer","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-14T23:44:00.490468Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-14T23:44:00.490712Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-14T23:44:00.503542Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-14T23:44:00.490690Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-14T23:44:00.502790Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":19},{"id":"310398a29fc4027","cell_type":"code","source":"# training_config = \"configs/config_3.3-candidate-2epochs-ia.json\"\nmodel_config = {\n    \"dataset_name\": f\"{dataset_config['starting_language']}_translate_describe\",\n    \"model_id\": \"google/gemma-2-2b-it\",\n    \"modules_to_save\": [\n        \"lm_head\"\n    ],\n    \"r\": 64,\n    \"lora_alpha\": 16,\n    \"epochs\": 2,\n    \"dropout\":0.3,\n    \"learning_rate\": 0.001,\n    \"lr_scheduler_type\": \"cosine\"\n}\n# model_config = json.load(open('YourConfFileHere.json'))\npprint(model_config)\n\nmodules_to_save = model_config.get(\"modules_to_save\")\ndataset_name = model_config.get(\"dataset_name\")\nepochs = model_config.get(\"epochs\")\nmodel_id = model_config.get(\"model_id\")\nlearning_rate = model_config.get(\"learning_rate\")\nlr_scheduler_type = model_config.get(\"lr_scheduler_type\")\nr = model_config.get(\"r\")\ndropout = model_config.get(\"dropout\")\nlora_alpha = model_config.get(\"lora_alpha\")","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"id":"c9af5ce6-dccb-4e64-ae33-0d975243dd0a","cell_type":"code","source":"model, tokenizer = load_base_model(model_id, max_seq_length)\n\ndataset_train = Dataset.load_from_disk(f\"datasets/{dataset_name}_train.hf\")\ndataset_test = Dataset.load_from_disk(f\"datasets/{dataset_name}_test.hf\")\n# Removing the \"describe\" dataset from the test set.\nds = dataset_test.to_pandas()\nds.pop(\"__index_level_0__\")\nds = ds[ds[\"task_type\"] == \"translate\"]\ndataset_test = Dataset.from_pandas(ds)\ndel ds\n_collect()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"id":"9b7d82fb-2a2a-4ca3-8be5-8312609b7bb1","cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Chapter 7.1: Model Preparation and Training Arguments\n\nThis section focuses on preparing the model for fine-tuning and defining the training arguments.\n\n* **Model Preparation:**\n\nThe `FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model` function is used to adapt the pre-trained model for fine-tuning with Unsloth.

Here, we assess the quality of the model's translations by comparing them to human-generated reference translations.\n\n### Sentence-level and Corpus-level Metrics\n\nThe code defines two primary functions for calculating metrics:\n\n* `sentence_metric`: This function calculates a metric score for a single translated sentence compared to its original counterpart. It takes three arguments:\n    * `translated`: The string representing the translated sentence.\n    * `original`: The string representing the original sentence.\n    * `metric`: This argument allows the user to choose between two common evaluation metrics for machine translation:\n        * **GLEU (Google-BLEU)**: This metric considers n-gram matches (sequences of n words) between the translated and reference sentences. \n        * **BLEU (bilingual evaluation understudy)**: Similar to GLEU, BLEU also calculates n-gram precision between the translated and reference sentences, incorporating a brevity penalty to discourage overly short translations.\n\nThe function dynamically retrieves the appropriate scoring method based on the selected metric (`gleu` or `bleu`) and returns the score for the single sentence pair.\n\n* `corpus_metric`: This function calculates the metric score for a complete set (corpus) of translated sentences compared to their corresponding original sentences. It takes three arguments:\n    * `translated`: A list of strings representing the translated sentences.\n    * `original`: A list of strings representing the original sentences.\n    * `metric`: Similar to `sentence_metric`, this argument allows the user to specify the desired evaluation metric (GLEU or BLEU).\n\nThe function first ensures that the lengths of both translated and original sentence lists are equal. Then, it iterates through each sentence pair, calculates the sentence-level score using the chosen metric, and finally retrieves the corpus-level score using the appropriate method. \n\n### Combining Metrics and User Choice\n\nThe `calculate_metrics` function brings everything together by providing a single point of entry for metric calculation. It takes three arguments:\n\n* `references`: A list of strings representing the original (reference) sentences.\n* `hypothesis`: A list of strings representing the model's translated (hypothesis) sentences.\n* `metric`: As before, this argument allows the user to choose between GLEU or BLEU for evaluation.\n\nThe function first calculates the sentence-level metric for each sentence pair and stores the results. It then returns a tuple containing the average sentence-level metric score across all sentences and the corpus-level metric score for the entire dataset.","metadata":{}},{"id":"66e284661dc26033","cell_type":"code","source":"def sentence_metric(translated: str, original: str, metric=gleu) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Calculates a sentence-level metric score between a translated and an original sentence.\n\n    Args:\n        :param: translated: The translated sentence (string).\n        :param: original: The original sentence (string).\n        :param: metric: The metric function to use {gleu, bleu}.\n\n    Returns:\n        :return: The sentence-level metric score (float).\n    \"\"\"\n    #

However, a different tokenizer (`load_correct_tokenizer`) is loaded specifically for the pre-trained Gemma-2 model (\"google/gemma-2-2b-it\"). This ensures compatibility with the expected tokenization format. The tokenizer's padding and end-of-sentence tokens are also explicitly set.\n\n* **Enabling Inference Mode:**\n\nThe `FastLanguageModel.for_inference(model)` function is called to switch the model to inference mode, optimizing it for generating text.\n\n###  Tokenization for Inference\n\n* **`tokenize_for_inference` Function:**\n\nThis function takes a list of input strings (`entries`) and the tokenizer as arguments. It utilizes the tokenizer's `apply_chat_template` method to format the input for the model, assuming a standard chat template format. The function optionally allows moving the tensors to the GPU for faster processing.\n\n* **Extracting Response:**\n\nThe `extract_response` function helps extract the model's generated response from the output string. It searches for the specific marker (`MODEL_START_TOKEN`) within the output, removes surrounding special tokens, and returns the core response text.\n\n###  Creating the Inference Dataset\n\n* **`create_inference_dataset` Function:**\n\nThis function takes several arguments:\n\n* `original_content`: A list of strings representing the original content to be translated.\n* `translated_content`: A list of strings representing the original human translations (for reference).\n* `ids`: A list of unique identifiers for each data point (optional).\n* `to_gpu`: A boolean flag indicating whether to move the tensors to the GPU (default: True).\n\nThe function first tokenizes the `original_content` using the `tokenize_for_inference` function. It then combines the tokenized inputs, original translations, and IDs (if provided) into a single tuple representing the inference dataset.\n\n* **Preprocessing for Inference:**\n\nThe script loads the testing dataset from the specified path and filters it to include only entries with the \"translate\" task type. It then creates a unique hash for each data point based on various attributes (topic, content, languages, etc.).\n\nFor the inference phase, a modified version of the `alpaca_prompt_template` is created by removing special tokens specific to the chat format. This ensures compatibility with the model during inference. Finally, the script applies this modified template to each data point, combining the translation instruction with the original content to create the final inference prompt.\n\nThe script renames the \"translated_content\" column to \"answer\" for clarity and selects only relevant columns for the inference process (topic, question, answer, starting language, and hash). It then groups the data by the starting language to create separate datasets for different languages.\n\n* **Example Inputs and Outputs:**\n\nThe script showcases how to retrieve sample input and output sentences from a specific language group (\"italian\") within the test dataset.\n\n###  Inference Processing\n\n* **Tokenize Example Sentence:**\n\nThis section demonstrates tokenizing an example input sentence using the `apply_chat_template` method and moving the tensors to the GPU for faster processing.\n\n* **Generating Response and Detokenization:**\n\nThe script first disables gradient calculation (with `torch.no_grad()`) for efficiency during inference. It then generates a response for the example sentence using the model's `generate` function. The generated response is detached from the computational graph and moved back to CPU memory. \n\nNext, it performs two detokenization steps:\n\n1. It removes the portion of the generated response corresponding to the original input sentence (based on the length of the tokenized input).\n2. It uses the tokenizer's `decode` function to convert the remaining token IDs back to human-readable text, excluding special tokens.\n\nFinally, it prints both the original human translation (example_out_sentence) and the detokenized model response for comparison.\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"854f5f6ff9cf695","cell_type":"code","source":"# Using the already fine-tuned model:\nnew_model = '/kaggle/input/gemma-2-2b-it_unsloth_interlingua_translate/transformers/v0/1'\ninference_config = {\n    \"dataset\": f\"datasets/{starting_language}_{'_'.join(DATASET_TYPES)}_test.hf\",\n    \"model\": new_model,\n}\n# The tokenizer is not loaded, this because we can fine-tune the non-instructed version of Gemma\nmodel, _ = load_base_model(\n    inference_config[\"model\"],\n    max_seq_length,\n)\n# No matter the model used, we use the same dataset-format (with standard chat template)\ntokenizer = load_correct_tokenizer(\"google/gemma-2-2b-it\")\ntokenizer.pad_token = \"<pad>\"\ntokenizer.eos_token = \"<eos>\"\nMODEL_START_TOKEN = \"<start_of_turn>model\"\nFastLanguageModel.for_inference(model)\n_collect()\n\n\ndef tokenize_for_inference(entries: List[str], tokenizer=tokenizer, to_gpu=False):\n    tokenized = [\n        tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n            [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": entry}], return_tensors=\"pt\"\n        )\n        for entry in entries\n    ]\n    if to_gpu:\n        tokenized = [entry.to(\"cuda\") for entry in tokenized]\n    return tokenized\n\n\ndef extract_response(model_response: str):\n    n = model_response.find(MODEL_START_TOKEN)\n    response = (\n        model_response[n:]\n        .replace(\"### Response:\\n\", \"\")\n        .removeprefix(MODEL_START_TOKEN)\n        .removesuffix(\"<end_of_turn>\")\n        .strip()\n    )\n    return response\n\n\ndef create_inference_dataset(original_content, translated_content, ids, to_gpu=True):\n    return (\n        tokenize_for_inference(original_content, to_gpu=to_gpu),\n        translated_content,\n        ids,\n    )\n\n\ndf_test = Dataset.load_from_disk(inference_config[\"dataset\"]).to_pandas()\n# Using only the `translate-related` dataset\ndf_test = df_test[df_test[\"task_type\"] == \"translate\"]\n# pprint(df_test.sample(1).to_dict(orient=\"records\"))\n# Create an id based on the dataset columns\ndf_test[\"hash\"] = df_test.apply(\n    lambda x: hash(\n        x[\"topic\"]\n        + \"|\"\n        + x[\"original_content\"]\n        + \"|\"\n        + x[\"translated_content\"]\n        + \"|\"\n        + x[\"starting_language\"]\n        + \"|\"\n        + x[\"translated_language\"]\n        + \"|\"\n        + x[\"task_type\"]\n        + \"|\"\n    ),\n    axis=1,\n)\n\n# For the inference phase, I use the `apply_chat_template` for compatibility, so we clean the template from the manually set special tokens.\nalpaca_prompt_template_inference = (\n    alpaca_prompt_template.replace(\"<start_of_turn>user\", \"\")\n    .replace(\"<end_of_turn>\", \"\")\n)\nalpaca_prompt_template_inference = alpaca_prompt_template_inference[:alpaca_prompt_template_inference.find('<start_of_turn>model')].strip()\n\n\ndf_test[\"question\"] = df_test.apply(\n    lambda row: alpaca_prompt_template_inference.format(\n        instruction_translate.format(\n            row[\"starting_language\"], row[\"translated_language\"]\n        ),\n        row[\"original_content\"],\n    ).strip(),\n    axis=1,\n)\ndf_test.rename(columns={\"translated_content\": \"answer\"}, inplace=True)\ndf_test = df_test[[\"topic\", \"question\", \"answer\", \"starting_language\", \"hash\"]]\n\ntest_datasets = {}\nfor group, _df in df_test.groupby(\"starting_language\"):\n    test_datasets[group] = _df.copy()\nfor k, v in test_datasets.items():\n    print(f\"{k} -> {len(v)}\")\n\nexample_in_sentence = (\n    test_datasets[\"italian\"].sample(1, random_state=43)[\"question\"].item()\n)\nexample_out_sentence = (\n    test_datasets[\"italian\"].sample(1, random_state=43)[\"answer\"].item()\n)\nprint(example_in_sentence, \"\\n-------\\n\", example_out_sentence)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-14T23:44:00.521760Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-14T23:44:00.521953Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-14T23:44:17.268111Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-14T23:44:00.521934Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-14T23:44:17.267236Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"==((====))==  Unsloth 2025.1.5: Fast Gemma2 patching.

For each group, it calls the `create_inference_dataset` function to create the input data for the model. This involves tokenizing the input questions using the chat template and preparing the corresponding reference translations (outputs) and unique identifiers (hashes). The resulting data is stored in the `inference_datasets` dictionary, where each key represents a language and the corresponding value is a dictionary containing the tokenized inputs, outputs, and IDs.\n\nThe code then demonstrates how to access the inputs and outputs for the \"italian\" language group and prints a single example of a tokenized input and its corresponding reference translation. This step is for illustrative purposes, showing the format of the data before it's fed to the model.\n\n### Generating Responses for the Dataset\n\n* **Generation Configuration:**\n\nA `generation_config` dictionary is defined to control the text generation process. The key parameter here is `max_new_tokens`, which limits the maximum number of tokens the model can generate for each input. This helps prevent the model from generating infinitely long responses. Other generation parameters (commented out in the code) could be used to control aspects like sampling, temperature, top-k/top-p sampling, and repetition penalty.\n\n* **Generating Translations:**\n\nThe code enters a `torch.no_grad()` context to disable gradient calculation during inference, which improves efficiency. It then iterates through each language group in the `inference_datasets` dictionary. For each language:\n\n1. It initializes an empty list called `response` within the `inference_dataset` dictionary.\n2. It iterates through the tokenized inputs for that language using `tqdm` to display a progress bar.\n3. For each input, it calls the model's `generate` function with the tokenized input and the `generation_config`. The generated output is detached from the computational graph and moved to the CPU.\n4. The generated output is appended to the `response` list.\n\n* **Saving Inference Results:**\n\nAfter generating responses for all languages, the `inference_datasets` dictionary, now containing the generated outputs, is saved to a pickle file. This allows for later analysis and evaluation without needing to regenerate the responses.\n\n* **Detokenization and Evaluation:**\n\nThe code then performs the following steps for evaluation:\n\n1. It selects one of the language groups (in this case, the first one encountered in the loop).\n2. It initializes an empty list called `detokenized_responses`.\n3. It iterates through the generated responses for the selected language.\n4. For each response, it extracts the generated part (by removing the input tokens) and decodes it using the tokenizer. The `extract_response` function is used to further clean the decoded text by removing special tokens and extra whitespace.\n5. The cleaned, detokenized response is appended to the `detokenized_responses` list.\n6. The `detokenized_responses` are assigned to the \"answer\" key of the language group's dictionary, overwriting the original human-generated answers.\n7. Finally, the `calculate_metrics` function is called to evaluate the generated translations against the original human translations (stored in `ds_response[\"outputs\"]`). The calculated metrics (sentence-level and corpus-level scores) are then printed.\n\nIn summary, this code performs the crucial steps of generating translations using the fine-tuned model, detokenizing the generated outputs, and evaluating the quality of the translations using appropriate metrics. The saving of the inference results to a pickle file provides a convenient way to store and reuse the generated outputs for further analysis or comparison.\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"6c2ed6cf71a0eba2","cell_type":"code","source":"inference_datasets = {}\nfor k, ds in test_datasets.items():\n    inputs, outputs, ids = create_inference_dataset(\n        ds[\"question\"].to_list(),\n        ds[\"answer\"].to_list(),\n        ds[\"hash\"].to_list(),\n    )\n    inference_datasets[k] = {\"inputs\": inputs, \"outputs\": outputs, \"ids\": ids}\ninputs, outputs = (\n    inference_datasets[\"italian\"][\"inputs\"],\n    inference_datasets[\"italian\"][\"outputs\"],\n)\nfor input_entry, output_entry in zip(inputs, outputs):\n    print(tokenizer.batch_decode(input_entry, skip_special_tokens=False)[0])\n    print(\"---\" * 30)\n    print(output_entry)\n    print(\"===\" * 30)\n    break\n_collect()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-14T23:44:32.678025Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-14T23:44:32.678277Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-14T23:44:34.856740Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-14T23:44:32.678247Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-14T23:44:34.856033Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"<bos><start_of_turn>user\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

Il gruppo fu formato dopo la morte di Joseph Smith, Jr., il 27 giugno 1844; fu un tentativo di riorganizzare la Chiesa di Gesù Cristo dei Santi degli Ultimi Giorni fondata da Joseph Smith Jr. Dopo l'assassinio del profeta alcuni membri si separarono dal tronco principale per formare vari gruppi rari come quello Strangita e quello del Tempio Lot, tuttavia tutti questi piccoli gruppi non ebbero uno sviluppo apprezzabile, di fatto la Comunità di Cristo è il gruppo più consistente con circa 250.000 membri mentre la chiesa originale ha oltre 12.000.000 (stima del 2005). Seguendo la morte del fondatore della religione, Joseph Smith, Jr., i nemici della chiesa credevano che il mormonismo fosse finito. Mentre alcuni piccoli gruppi si separarono per formare nuovi rami, il tronco principale guidato da Brigham Young fece una migrazione nello Utah, USA, e mantenne l'originario nome di Chiesa di Gesù Cristo dei Santi degli Ultimi Giorni. Una più piccola fazione rimase in Illinois, USA, per vari motivi, inclusi disaccordi con i Dodici Apostoli mormoni e la paura di fare il lungo e difficile viaggio in Utah. Alcuni in quel gruppo riconobbero Brigham Young come leader e credevano che Joseph Smith, Jr., avesse nominato suo figlio maggiore Joseph Smith III come suo successore.<end_of_turn>\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLe Communitate de Christo, originalmente cognoscite como le Ecclesia de Jesus Christo del Sanctos del Ultime Dies Reorganisate, es un fide Mormon.

Il paese occupa un piano semiarido coperto di savana e attraversato da tre grandi fiumi: il Senegal, il Gambia e il Casamance. Ad ovest si trova la penisola di Capo Verde, che dà il nome all'arcipelago di Capo Verde. L'impero Songhai fiorì nel territorio dell'attuale Senegal prima della colonizzazione europea. Dopo l'indipendenza, il Senegal formò con la Repubblica Sudanese (l'attuale Mali) la Federazione del Mali, ma poi lasciò la federazione. Il Senegal è ora una repubblica con sistema semipresidenziale. La popolazione è generalmente povera. L'economia è basata sull'agricoltura e sulla pesca fluviale. Uno dei suoi prodotti più importanti è l'arachide, di cui il paese è un grande esportatore. Oltre al francese, lingua ufficiale, la costituzione riconosce sei lingue nazionali: il wolof, il serer, il peul, il maninkar, il soninke e il diola. Il wolof è la lingua utilizzata come lingua franca dalla maggior parte delle persone. Circa il 92% della popolazione senegalese è di confessione musulmana. Il sufismo è popolare nel paese; i più grandi ordini mistici sono il tijani e il muridar. Il Senegal è uno stato membro dell'Unione Africana, delle Nazioni Unite, dell'Organizzazione Internazionale della Francofonia, della Comunità Economica degli Stati dell'Africa Occidentale e di altre organizzazioni internazionali.<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n### Response:\nSenegal es un pais francophone de Africa del West.
