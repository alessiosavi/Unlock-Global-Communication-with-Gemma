    "The goal of this project is to be able to basically translate any dialect to the original \"base\" languages, without dealing with a complex data pipeline.\n",
    "Due to this, I've built a straightforward pipeline that leverages \"lemmatization and contextual similarity\" on the text dialect dataset in order to enhance the translation of the text. The concept idea, is to translate something that it's basically not understandable by any existing model, to a simplified version of the text, passing through the lemmatization.\n",

In Syracuse, a ritual bath enclosure dating back to the 6th century was found. Until 1492, the year in which Queen Isabella I of Castile ordered the expulsion of Jews who did not convert from the territory of the Spanish monarchy, the Kingdom of Sicily was inhabited by a Jewish community for centuries in the island. The Jews lived in these peripheral quarters of the city, and the most important were in Palermo, Trapani, and Syracuse.

      "The Bologna massacre is one of the most serious terrorist acts that have bloodied Italy in the post-war period, which occurred on Saturday, August 2, 1980. At 10:25 in the waiting room of the Bologna railway station a time bomb exploded in an abandoned suitcase, killing 85 people and injuring another 200. For Bologna and for Italy it was a dramatic awakening to the resurgence of terrorism. The explosion was felt for many kilometers and destroyed a large part of the station, derailing the Ancona-Chiasso train. On that day the station was crowded with tourists and people departing or returning from vacation. The city, unprepared for such an event, responded with speed: not having enough ambulances to transport the injured to the city hospital, buses and taxis were also used.\n",
